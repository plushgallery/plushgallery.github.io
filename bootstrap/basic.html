          <h2>What is Bootstrap?</h2>
          <p>Bootstrap is an open source, free front-end web development tool for developing websites. It uses a variety of customizable HTML and CSS templates, as well as workable Javascript extensions. Source code for each of these frameworks, as well as nav bars and a variety of components is available at the download page. Current versions of Bootstrap also support responsive web design.</p>

          <h2>Bootstrap Templates</h2>
          <p>There are any number of Bootstrap template pages available on the web, but those from the W3 Schools tutorial site are great to work with because they clearly demonstrate the structure of a variety of webpage template designs: Blog, Portfolio (Jumbotron), Webpage, Social Media, Marketing, Analytics, and Online Store (Jumbotron). In this exercise, we will be working with variations to a Jumbotron page design.   </p>

          <h2>Assignment</h2>
          <p>In this assignment, we will work with the Bootstrap Jumbotron template, using three CSS class selectors to alter the responsiveness of the Jumbotron container. The three class selectors: .jumbotron1, .jumbotron2, and .jumbotron3 will each have a different background, font-family and font-style, and padding, which are coded into the CSS styles for this page. We will also test the page through the W3C validator service to check for how it conforms to standards.</p>
