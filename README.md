<h3>Hello World!</h3>

<p>This is the initial commit for the <b>plushgallery / webdevdemo</b>.

It will serve as a resource for learning about <b>GitHub</b>.

If you've made it this far, you've already signed up for GitHub.
The next step is to set up your <b>Profile</b>.
It will include personal information (to begin), repository information, and contribution information.</p>

<h3>Search</h3>

<p>The next thing you can do, is to use the <b>Search</b> function at the top of the screen.
You can use that to search for tools and code to use in your projects.
Please note that it has two modes: global and repository.</p>

<h3>Project Page</h3>

<p>The next feature of GitHub is a <b>Project Page</b>.
It has four parts: 1) a Header, 2) Project Information, 3) Source Code, and 4) README.md.

In the <b>Header</b>, you can learn about Code, Issues, Pull Requests, Pulse, and Graphs for your project,
as well as Watch, Star, and Fork, which we will learn more about later.

The <b>Project Information</b> area shows 1) Commits, 2) Branches, 3) Releases, and 4) Contributors.

Commits are the changes you have made to each version of the Repository.</br>
Branches are a way to protect your main code, by branching off from it in subsequent versions.</br>
Releases are when a completed version of your code is ready to share as a package.</br>
Contributors are the programmers who have worked with you on a project.</br></p>

<h3>Creating a Repository</h3>

<p>To create a new project, click on the plus sign at the top right of the screen, and select <b>New Repository</b>. On the next page, you will initialize the repository with a README file, select whether it will be public or private, and choose a license, then select <b>Create Repository</b>.</p>

<h3>Setting up README</h3>

<p>You will then set up your README.md file. It should describe and and give basic information on your project. You can preview the README using <b>Preview Changes</b>, and then when you are ready <b>Commit changes</b> to <b>push</b> it to your repository.</p>

<p>This is enough to get started. Good luck... now <b>Hello World!</b></p>
